# BeginToSee
An introductory repository dedicated to foundational image processing and computer vision techniques using OpenCV. Ideal for beginners looking to grasp the core concepts and dive into the world of visual computing.

## Introduction
Welcome to BeginToSee, your gateway to the exciting world of image processing and computer vision. This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to essential techniques using OpenCV and Python.

## Repository Contents
- **colorPick.py**: A Python script for real-time color detection and tracking using a webcam or image source. Choose from predefined or custom colors, initialize color ranges, and visualize color detection.

## Updates in the "colorPick.py" Branch

In the "colorPick.py" branch of this repository, we've added some exciting new features to enhance color detection and image manipulation. These features include:

- **Eraser Functionality**: You can now erase colors from the image by pressing 'B' on the keyboard. This feature allows you to interactively remove detected colors from the frame.

- **Eraser Size Magnification**: To make the eraser more versatile, you can also adjust its size by pressing specific keys on the keyboard.

- **Clear Image**: If you want to start fresh or clear the image entirely, you can do so by pressing 'C' on the keyboard.

These enhancements provide more control and interactivity when using the `colorPick.py` script. Be sure to check out the updated code and demonstration videos to see these features in action!

## Videos
Explore the videos in the main branch to learn how to utilize a webcam or image as the source for color detection. Discover techniques for real-time detection of predefined and custom colors, incorporating saved color values, and visualizing the results with both images and video feeds.
