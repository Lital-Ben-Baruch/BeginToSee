# BeginToSee
An introductory repository dedicated to foundational image processing and computer vision techniques using OpenCV. Ideal for beginners looking to grasp the core concepts and dive into the world of visual computing.

## Introduction
Welcome to BeginToSee, your gateway to the exciting world of image processing and computer vision. This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to essential techniques using OpenCV and Python.

## Repository Contents
- **camera_live_feed.py**: Basic Python script for capturing live video from a camera source and displaying it.
- **SmartDocScanner.py**: Main script for the SmartDocScanner project, which aims to scan and correct documents presented to the camera.
- **colorPick.py**: A Python script for real-time color detection and tracking using a webcam or image source. Choose from predefined or custom colors, initialize color ranges, and visualize color detection.
- **select_points_in_image.py**: Python script for selecting points on an image interactively. Points are displayed on the image.
